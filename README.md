# LiFePO4 phase diagram calculations

This repository contains the calculated phase diagram of LiFePO4 for two sets of parameters,
from Yiu et al.[^1] and Toft-Petersen et al.[^2], as described in the paper
_S. Holm-Janas et al._ "Magnetic structure and magnetoelectric properties of the spin-flop phase in LiFePOâ‚„".

The calculations uses the mean-field approximation as implemented in the [McPhase](http://mcphase.de/) program.

Note that some output files have been compressed with gzip.

There is a Python script to plot the data as shown in the paper, which requires `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
